What do you mean lobby?
----------

This implementation of the SimpleLobby is the base implementation. This means that it tries to not do anything entirely fancy.

Once you get this NodeJS up and running you will be given a simple input for the users nickname. Then all users will be notified that they've joined, and everyone can get started right away on communicating. Remember, communication is key!
