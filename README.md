SimpleLobbyDataStore
==========

A simple chat application created using NodeJS, Express, SocketIO and Knockout.

DataStore??

This implementation of the SimpleLobby uses the built in Data Storage that SocketIO has to offer. Through some minimal googling and StackOverflow it appears that the configuration of SocketIO can bet set to use your own Data Storage.

So what?

This opens up the posibility of using built in SocketIO functions to send/retrieve data from your favorite type of Database Software with just some simple changes to the configuration files. Isn't that snazzy?!
